int, float, string, bool, structs

### Notes

# Use of go.sum and go.mod

- go.mod is critical for defining your project's dependencies.
- go.sum ensures the dependencies are downloaded correctly and consistently.
- Do not remove them unless absolutely necessary and you know what you're doing. If youâ€™re troubleshooting, regenerate them using go mod tidy.
